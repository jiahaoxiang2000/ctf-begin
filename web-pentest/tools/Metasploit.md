# Metasploit

The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more.

## Main Components of Metasploit

- exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system.
- Payload: Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

main components of Metasploit are:

- Auxiliary: Auxiliary modules are used to perform various tasks such as scanning, fuzzing, and information gathering.
- Encoders: Encoders are used to encode the payload to avoid detection by antivirus software.
- Evasion: Evasion modules are used to bypass antivirus software.
- Exploits: Exploits are used to exploit vulnerabilities in the target system.
- NOPs: NOPs are used to fill the memory of the target system.
- Payloads: Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.
- Post: Post-exploitation modules are used to gather information from the target system after exploitation.

## Msfconsole

- use one exploit
- show options
- set RHOST...
- end exploit `back`
- `info` to get information about the exploit
- `search` to search for an exploit (type:auxiliary)
