the web security risks that are most critical to web applications. [room link](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/owasptop102021).

## 1 broken access control

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages can lead to the following:

- Being able to view sensitive information from other users
- Accessing unauthorized functionality

## 2 cryptographic failures

MD5 attack, [Crack station](https://crackstation.net/) is a good example of a website that can crack hashes.

## 3 injection

Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

## 4 insecure design

Insecure design refers to vulnerabilities which are inherent to the application's architecture. e.g. not using HTTPS, not hashing passwords, etc.

## 5 security misconfiguration

not close the debug mode, not close the ports, etc.

## 6 vulnerable and outdated components

some cve is open on the exploit database, and the attacker can use it to attack the system.
