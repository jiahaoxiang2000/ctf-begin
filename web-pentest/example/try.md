## PHP not work

### info collection

- This site has been made using PHP with MYSQL (procedure functions)!
- have one page to login `admin_verify.php`, form data `name=ss&pass=sss&submit=Submit+Query`.
- one add the address `process.php`, form data `card_type=VISA&card_number=sss&card_PID=sss&card_expire=&card_owner=ss` the response is following:
  
```plaintext
insert false !Incorrect integer value: '' for column `www_project`.`customers`.`customerid` at row 1
```

so here we can inject the SQL query.

### exploit

the add the cart `process.php`, have the error, because the user not logged in, so we can use the `admin_verify.php` to login and then add the cart.
